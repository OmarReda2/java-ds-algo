Pseudo Code:

Initialize the function:

Check if the queue is empty:

If isEmpty() returns true, return null.

Otherwise, return the top element of stack1 by popping it.





Step-by-Step Process

Using the queue from above [1, 2, 3, 4] (front of queue is 1, stack1: [1, 2, 3, 4], top is 1):

Check if empty:

stack1 is not empty, so proceed.

Pop from stack1:

Pop the top element (1) from stack1.

Return 1.

Now: stack1: [2, 3, 4] (top is 2), stack2: [].

Queue is now [2, 3, 4] (front is 2).



ðŸŽ¨ Visual Representation:



Diagram 1: Before dequeue

Queue: [1, 2, 3, 4] (front: 1, back: 4)
stack1:        stack2:
  1  <- top    (empty)
  2
  3
  4


Diagram 2: After dequeue

Queue: [2, 3, 4] (front: 2, back: 4)
stack1:        stack2:
  2  <- top    (empty)
  3
  4

==> 1 popped and returned
