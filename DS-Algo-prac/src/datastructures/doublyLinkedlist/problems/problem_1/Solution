The method swaps the values of the first and last nodes in the list.

The method checks if the length of the list is less than 2, meaning that the list has either zero or one element, in which case there is no need to swap anything, and the method just returns.

Otherwise, the method creates a temporary variable temp to store the value of the head node, which is the first node in the list.  Then, it assigns the value of the tail node, which is the last node in the list, to the value of the head node.  Finally, it assigns the value of the temporary variable temp to the value of the tail node.

By doing so, the values of the first and last nodes in the list are swapped.





Code with inline comments:



public void swapFirstLast() {
    // If there are less than two nodes in the list, there's nothing to swap
    if (length < 2) return;

    // Swap the values of the head and tail nodes
    int temp = head.value;
    head.value = tail.value;
    tail.value = temp;
}
