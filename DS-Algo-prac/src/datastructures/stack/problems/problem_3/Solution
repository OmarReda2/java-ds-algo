    public static String reverseString(String string) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
        String reversedString = "";

        for (char c : string.toCharArray()) {
            stack.push(c);
        }

        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            reversedString += stack.pop();
        }

        return reversedString;
    }




This code defines a method called reverseString which takes a single argument of type String and returns a String.  The method first creates an empty Stack object that will be used to reverse the string, and an empty String object that will hold the reversed string.

Next, the method loops through each character in the input String and pushes each character onto the stack one at a time. Once all the characters have been pushed onto the stack, the method then pops each character off the stack one at a time, appending them to the reversedString variable.

Finally, the method returns the reversedString, which is the original string in reverse order.





Code with inline comments:



public static String reverseString(String string) {
    // Create a new stack of characters.
    Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
    // Create an empty string for the reversed characters.
    String reversedString = "";

    // Loop through each character in the original string and push it onto the stack.
    for (char c : string.toCharArray()) {
        stack.push(c);
    }

    // Pop each character off the stack and add it to the reversed string.
    // This will reverse the order of the characters in the original string.
    while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
        reversedString += stack.pop();
    }

    // Return the reversed string.
    return reversedString;
}
